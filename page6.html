    <p>Entry #0520</p>
    
    <p>I have not seen Marden since that night. The Guild claimed he fell ill. His name was struck from the rosters. His quarters were emptied before I could retrieve the pages I know he kept. But it doesn’t matter. I have found what he found.</p>

    <p>The ritual was not designed to burn the ward. It was meant to open something. A channel. A gate. The circle they used was old, scratched into the stone beneath a false floor. I memorized every line. Every symbol. Then I spent a season deciphering them. It took months to gather what I needed.</p>

    <p>Not rare reagents, not power. Understanding.</p>

    <p>I mapped the patterns from Marden’s ash-ring to the spiral of the soldier’s wound, to symbols scrawled on the underside of a discarded ledger I found buried behind a false shelf in the guild archives. They aligned. Not perfectly, but precisely enough to complete the equation.</p>

    <p>The ritual was not elegant. It was a scaffolding. Broken pieces stitched into function. But it held.</p>

    <p>I cleared the storeroom below my quarters. The walls were stone, the air dry. I traced the ring in ink, not blood. I did not yet trust my own body in the equation.</p>

    <p>I lit the candles. Burned the parchment. Spoke the words.</p>

    <p>At first, silence.</p>

    <p>Then the ink began to move. Not run. Move. As though something beneath the surface was breathing through it.</p>

    <p>The room darkened unnaturally, like smoke had thickened the shadows. And then, a voice.</p>

    <p>Not loud. Not even audible. But I felt it inside the base of my skull, like thought reversed.</p>

    <p>"You are not like the others," it said.</p>

    <p>I asked what it was.</p>

    <p>It laughed. Not cruelly. Patiently.</p>

    <p>"I am what you seek."</p>

    <p>I demanded knowledge. It offered a name. Not its own, but mine, twisted and ancient.</p>

    <p>I refused it.</p>

    <p>"Good," it said.</p>

    <p>And then the light returned, all at once, and I was alone again. But the ink on the floor still pulsed. And my hand, the one I used to draw the circle, trembled, not with fear, but with something closer to hunger.</p>

    <p>I had spoken to a demon. It knew me. And I had not been consumed.</p>

    <p>That was the moment I knew:</p>

    <p>The line between man and monster is not drawn by nature.</p>

    <p>It is drawn by choice.</p>
