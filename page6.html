    <p>Entry #0520</p>
    
    <p>I have not seen Marden since that night. The Guild claimed he fell ill. His name was struck from the rosters. His quarters were emptied before I could retrieve the pages I know he kept. But it doesn’t matter. I have found what he found.</p>

    <p>The ritual was not designed to burn the ward. It was meant to open something. A channel. A gate. The circle they used was old, scratched into the stone beneath a false floor. I memorized every line. Every symbol. Then I spent a season deciphering them.</p>

    <p>Some nights I forgot to sleep. Most nights I forgot to eat. I could feel the meaning behind the markings like a breath against glass. Always there, but never sharp. And then, one evening, with a fresh-cut circle and lines drawn in blood and ash, I spoke the words I had translated.</p>

    <p>The room did not shake. There was no thunder or crackling flame. Just stillness. And then a voice, not heard with ears, but known. Like a presence leaning into the spine.</p>

    <p>It asked me who I was.</p>

    <p>I told it. Nothing more. And it replied:</p>

    <p>That is not yet true. But it will be.</p>

    <p>I asked it what it was.</p>

    <p>It gave no name. Only silence. But in that silence, I understood. It was not offering me a pact. It was not demanding my soul. It had no use for obedience. It had waited, and now it had been found. Or perhaps I had.</p>

    <p>I asked it why me. It said only this:</p>

    <p>Because you saw what others missed. You watched. You learned. You wanted to know.</p>

    <p>And then it was gone. Not banished. Not dismissed. Gone, as if it had never been. But I can still feel where it was. In the corners of the room. Beneath the ink in my journal. It is not a possession. It is a direction.</p>

    <p>The circle remains. I have not cleaned it.</p>
