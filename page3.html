    <p>He was a soldier by the look of him. Not a young one. Sun dried skin, calloused knuckles, a dozen scars that said more about his profession than any tabard could. He came to me without ceremony, limping, one arm pressed against his side.</p>

    <p>The wound was putrid. A shallow burn across his skin. It curled at the edges like fire had bitten into the flesh, but the center had cooled strangely smooth. He said it came from a blade. When I asked what kind, he looked away and muttered something about green flames.</p>

    <p>I have heard of the Arcane, but this was completely different to anything I'd ever seen. This wound was real. I could touch it. Smell it. It hummed under the skin like heat trapped in stone.</p>

    <p>I applied salve, it may dull the pain. He thanked me, paid in coin that smelled faintly of ash, and left without another word.</p>

    <p>I kept the rag I used to clean the wound. Pressed it flat between the pages of my ledger. Not out of fear or morbid fascination. But because I saw something in the way the skin had scorched. A shape. A rhythm.</p>

    <p>Even chaos has pattern. And if that is true, then it can be studied.</p>
