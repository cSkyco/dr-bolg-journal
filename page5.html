    <p>The guild archivist was named Marden. A bent, narrow man with parchment skin and a voice like dry leaves. I had known him most of my life. He taught me how to catalogue properly, how to preserve pages without warping the ink, how to bind a spine without splitting the vellum.</p>

    <p>He also lied to my face.</p>

    <p>The fire, he claimed, had been investigated. A report filed. Natural cause. Poor maintenance. He shuffled the ledgers away when I entered the library. He changed subject too quickly. He stopped asking how I was.</p>

    <p>So I watched him. Quietly. For weeks.</p>

    <p>I followed him once, past curfew, cloaked in the smoke of the slums. He met with others, five men, all older, all quiet, robes pressed and hands hidden in sleeves. They spoke low and brief in the shadow of a half-burned bell tower, then vanished through a broken cellar door.</p>

    <p>I returned alone later. Nothing left but ash under a stone ring. But the burn marks they weren’t black. They were green.</p>

    <p>The same curling residue. The same scorched spiral patterns I had seen before.</p>

    <p>These men were no warriors. No mages. One limped with a cane. Another needed help stepping down. Yet they had summoned something that shattered stone and devoured half a ward.</p>

    <p>Power did not come from youth, or strength, or blessing. It came because they took it.</p>

    <p>And if they could take it… so could I.</p>
