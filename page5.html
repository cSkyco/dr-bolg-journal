    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>The archivist’s hands shook as he poured the tea. Old, bent, near blind. A man like that should not inspire suspicion. But I had begun to look at the world differently since the fire.</p>

    <p>He claimed to know nothing of the green fire. Not even in theory. Yet when I mentioned the strange pattern scorched into stone, his eyes narrowed before he turned away. A moment too long. A breath held too tightly.</p>

    <p>I waited three nights. Then followed him.</p>

    <p>Through the east stairwell. Past the lower stacks. Into the catacombs beneath the guild. He had a key I had never seen before. The door it opened was not in any guild records.</p>

    <p>There were others down there. Four, maybe five. Robed, whispering, gathered in a circle around a symbol drawn in chalk. I did not understand the words. But I understood the posture. This was worship. Not of Light, or law, or legacy — but of something older. Something that answered back.</p>

    <p>They were frail, every one of them. Aged men, forgotten by the city. But when they spoke, the flame that lit their circle burned green. Their voices rang clear. There was power in it. More than I’d ever seen a mortal wield. More than they should have wielded.</p>

    <p>They did not see me. I left in silence. I told no one.</p>

    <p>But I understood, then, that strength need not be earned. It could be seized. If one knew where to look.</p>
