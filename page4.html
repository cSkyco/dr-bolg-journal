    <p>The fire started in the upper tiers and swept down like judgment. Stone cracked from the heat. Smoke clung to the bones of the city. They said it was a hearth left untended. A careless flame in the home of a magistrate. A tragedy.</p>

    <p>But I have seen careless flames before.</p>

    <p>I was out when it happened. On the southern edge, tending to an outbreak of fever. By the time I returned, the smoke had already settled like a second roof across Stratholme’s skyline. My home was gone. My mother’s inkstone lay cracked in the rubble. They did not find her body, only the iron tip of her stylus, warped by heat.</p>

    <p>Grief did not come as wailing or collapse. It arrived as stillness. A cold, deliberate silence that sat beside me as I sorted through ash and ruin. I spent four nights in what was left of the ward, cataloguing, watching, questioning.</p>

    <p>On the fifth night, I found it. A patch of stone along the alley wall, scorched, but not blackened. The residue shimmered faintly when struck by moonlight. And the pattern. Not streaked like soot, but coiled, spiralled. Familiar.</p>

    <p>I returned home and pulled out the rag. The one from the old soldier’s wound. Aged now, brittle, but still stained with that faint green burn. I compared the shapes. The ridges. The curling. Identical.</p>

    <p>I asked the guild archivist if there had been records of green fire. He said nothing.</p>
