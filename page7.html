    <p>Entry #633</p>
    
    <p>He came to my door well after dusk. Blood across his chest. Panic in his eyes. Said he had been attacked in the alley, something fast, something strong. I helped him in, told him to sit, and began the examination.</p>

    <p>He had a puncture wound beneath the ribs, but it had missed the lung. The bleeding was messy, not dangerous. The real threat was the infection. It had already begun to set in, festering along the edges, veins turning dark and hot.</p>

    <p>I asked him his name. He hesitated. Then lied.</p>

    <p>I know a thief when I see one. I have stitched enough of them back together. This one had seen something he should not have, or stolen from someone worse than himself. Either way, he had not come here for healing. He had come here to disappear.</p>

    <p>So I gave him what he wanted.</p>

    <p>Fel magic does not scream. It hisses. Quiet. Precise. Like ink poured into warm water. I placed my hand over the wound and whispered the command I had practiced in silence a hundred times.</p>

    <p>He convulsed once. Eyes wide. And then still.</p>

    <p>The body cooled fast. The mark beneath his skin spread like roots from the point of contact. I studied it. Measured it. Took notes on the response time, the density of tissue degradation, the residual effect on nearby nerves.</p>

    <p>When I was finished, I burned what was left. Not out of guilt. Simply protocol.</p>

    <p>This is not a descent. This is clarity. I was never meant to heal the dying. I was meant to study the living.</p>
