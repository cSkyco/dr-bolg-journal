      They were just men.<br><br>

      Seven of them. Rags for cloaks, rusted blades, sun-hardened eyes. They were not soldiers, not trained. Desperation had made them bold.<br><br>

      We were three caravans deep, bound south toward Dawnswatch, where a plague of boils had taken root in the village wells. I had agreed to consult. There was coin in it. And materials I needed.<br><br>

      They struck near the bramble pass. Fell on the lead cart first. Screams cut short. Wood splintered. The second cart overturned. Oxen ran. I was in the third.<br><br>

      We heard them coming. The driver leapt from the seat and ran. I did not.<br><br>

      I waited.<br><br>

      When they opened the door, they found me seated, unmoved, a closed tome in my lap and green stillness in my eyes.<br><br>

      The first to step forward lost his face. It peeled back in a wave of heat and ash. The second caught the edge of a bolt meant for another and folded backwards over the wheel. The others screamed, but it came out wrong, like they had forgotten how breath worked.<br><br>

      I had studied the sigils for months. Whispered their sounds into still air. The power had remained silent until now. But it knew what I wanted.<br><br>

      It always knew.<br><br>

      What I summoned was not elegant. It did not float, or weave, or sing like Arcane. It cracked the sky open. It boiled marrow in the bone. And it did not stop when they begged.<br><br>

      When it was done, the forest smelled of copper and fire. I stepped over the ruin of the second cart and retrieved a satchel that had not yet burned.<br><br>

      Inside was the cloth. The first cloth. Still stained. Still warm.<br><br>

      I fed it to the Continuum.<br><br>

      It accepted the offering.<br><br>

      And I kept walking.
