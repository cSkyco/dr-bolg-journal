    <p>I was born in the inner ward of Stratholme, in a narrow stone house tucked behind the apothecary guildhall. My father, Aldric Bolgrain, worked as a senior alchemist in the guild, a quiet and precise man. He never smiled, but he wasn’t cruel. Just... consumed by the work.</p>

    <p>My mother, Liora, was a scribe, not the kind who copied books, but the kind who wrote them. Legal records, merchant contracts, inheritance claims, the slow machinery of a city’s memory. She was sharp and tireless, and the only person who could match my father’s discipline word for word.</p>

    <p>We were not poor, but neither were we noteworthy. I remember the smell of parchment and tinctures more vividly than any celebration. My schooling was arranged by my mother’s employer, a magistrate who owed her too many favours to refuse. I enjoyed it. Structure suited me. Precision suited me.</p>

    <p>I did not spend my youth in the company of many other children. I had no siblings. My lessons were solitary, and my interests were quiet: anatomy, herbalism, logic, and a growing curiosity for how the body broke down and why. By the time I was eleven I had copied out three volumes of medical theory by hand. Not for glory, nor for a tutor’s praise. Simply because I wanted to understand.</p>

    <p>The Bolgrain name opened a few doors, but I never relied on it. I cleaned the floors of the guildhall when asked, restocked vials, measured and catalogued. I was expected to be useful. So I was.</p>

    <p>There is little else worth recounting from those early years and that, I think, is what made them valuable. Everything was quiet. Ordered. And I learned early that order is a rare thing in this world.</p>
